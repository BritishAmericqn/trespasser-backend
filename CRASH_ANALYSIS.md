# üîç Server Crash Analysis

## Symptoms
- Server runs fine initially
- Eventually becomes a "slideshow" (very laggy)
- Then completely stops responding
- No error messages in terminal

## Remaining Performance Issues

### 1. **Console Logs Still Active** üö®
Found active logging at 5% chance:
- Movement calculations logging
- Player spawn logs  
- Physics body creation logs

Even at 5%, with 60Hz input rate = 3 logs/second per player!

### 2. **String Creation Memory Pressure**
The vision system creates thousands of strings per frame:
```typescript
visiblePixels.add(`${x},${y}`); // Creates new string for EVERY pixel
```
With 3,600 pixels √ó 8 players = 28,800 string allocations per vision update!

### 3. **Set to Array Conversion**
In `getFilteredGameState()`:
```typescript
visiblePixels: Array.from(visionState.visiblePixels) // Creates new array every broadcast
```
This creates massive arrays (3,600 items) 20 times per second per player!

### 4. **Possible Memory Leak**
The constant string creation and array conversion could be causing:
- Garbage collection pauses (causes the "slideshow" effect)
- Memory exhaustion (causes the silent crash)

## Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Disable ALL console logs**
2. **Use number pairs instead of strings for pixels**
3. **Reuse arrays instead of creating new ones**
4. **Add error boundaries to catch crashes**
