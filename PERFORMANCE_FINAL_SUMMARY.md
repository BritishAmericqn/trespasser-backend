# ðŸŽ¯ Performance Issues Fixed - Final Summary

## The Real Culprit: Matter.js Physics Engine

The main issue was **Matter.js running at 60Hz even with nothing happening**. This was causing:
- Constant physics calculations for all walls
- Collision detection running continuously
- CPU at 30-50% usage with no players moving
- Your laptop heating up

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. **Physics Only When Needed** âœ…
- Matter.js now only runs when projectiles exist
- Added `activeBodies` tracking to PhysicsSystem
- Physics engine sleeps when nothing is moving

### 2. **Projectile Early Exit** âœ…
- ProjectileSystem skips update when no projectiles
- Saves 60 function calls per second

### 3. **Memory Leak Fixed** âœ…
- Removed setInterval creating intervals for each player
- No more accumulating timers

### 4. **Console Logs Disabled** âœ…
- All debug logs commented out
- Console.log is expensive in browsers

### 5. **Vision Optimizations** âœ…
- Updates every 3 frames instead of every frame
- Cache extended from 100ms to 200ms
- Movement threshold increased to 5px

## Results You Should See

- **CPU**: From 30-50% â†’ 5-10% idle
- **With projectiles**: 15-20% (reasonable)
- **Laptop heat**: Should be minimal
- **Performance**: Smooth like Among Us

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Clear browser cache** - Old JS might be cached
2. **Check for zombie processes**: `pkill -9 node`
3. **Fresh start**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.cache
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Why Among Us Works on Phones

- No physics engine
- Simple collision detection
- Binary network protocol
- Minimal calculations per frame
- No console logging

Your game now follows similar principles!
