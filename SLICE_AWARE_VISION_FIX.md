# âœ… Slice-Aware Vision Fix

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: Destroying one 10px slice allowed vision through entire 50px wall (40px leak)
- **After**: Vision only passes through the specific destroyed slice(s)

## Implementation Details

### What Changed
Modified `TileVisionSystem.castRay()` to check which specific slice a ray passes through:

```typescript
// Calculate which slice this ray would pass through
const sliceWidth = partial.wallWidth / 5; // 5 slices per wall
const relativeX = rayPixelX - partial.wallPosition.x;
const sliceIndex = Math.floor(relativeX / sliceWidth);

// Check if this specific slice is destroyed
const sliceDestroyed = (partial.destroyedSlices >> sliceIndex) & 1;
```

### How It Works
1. Ray hits a wall tile with partial destruction
2. Convert ray position from tiles to pixels
3. Calculate which of the 5 slices the ray would pass through
4. Check if that specific slice is destroyed using bit masking
5. Only allow vision if the exact slice is destroyed

## Benefits
- **Tactical Precision**: Create specific sight lines by destroying specific slices
- **No More Vision Leaks**: 10px hole = 10px vision, not 50px
- **Realistic Gameplay**: Can't see through intact parts of walls
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead (one division, one bit check)

## Testing
To verify it works:
1. Shoot slice 2 of a wall
2. Only rays passing through slice 2's 10px area continue
3. Rays hitting slices 0, 1, 3, or 4 are blocked
4. Result: Precise 10px peek hole, not 50px gap

## Technical Details
- No changes to destruction system
- No changes to physics/collision
- No changes to networking
- Only modified vision raycasting logic
- Backwards compatible with existing wall data

## Why This Approach Won
- **Simple**: ~20 lines of code vs. complete system overhaul
- **Focused**: Fixed the actual problem (vision leak)
- **Low Risk**: Didn't touch working systems
- **Fast**: Implemented in 30 minutes vs. days of debugging

## Future Considerations
If you later want full segment system for paint-to-map:
1. This fix doesn't prevent that
2. Proves the concept works
3. Players already used to slice-precise vision
4. Can migrate when actually needed
