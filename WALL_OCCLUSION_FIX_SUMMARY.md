# 🧱 Wall Occlusion Fix Summary

## The Problem
Frontend reported: "Walls don't obscure vision" - the fog of war wasn't respecting wall boundaries.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Backend Vision Calculation - WORKING
The vision system correctly:
- Checks if pixels are blocked by walls (`isWallBlocking`)
- Respects destruction masks (intact slices block, destroyed ones don't)
- Stops scanlines and rays when hitting walls
- Calculates ~5000-15000 visible pixels per player

### ❌ Data Transmission - NOT WORKING
The critical issue: **Vision data was calculated but never sent to frontend!**

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Added Vision Field to GameState Interface
```typescript
// shared/types/index.ts
export interface GameState {
  // ... existing fields ...
  vision?: {
    visiblePixels: string[];  // Array of "x,y" strings
    viewAngle: number;
    position: Vector2;
  };
}
```

### 2. Include Vision Data in Game State
```typescript
// GameStateSystem.ts - getFilteredGameState()
return {
  players: visiblePlayersObject as any,
  projectiles: visibleProjectiles,
  walls: wallsObject as any,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  tickRate: GAME_CONFIG.TICK_RATE,
  vision: visionState ? {
    visiblePixels: Array.from(visionState.visiblePixels), // Convert Set to Array
    viewAngle: visionState.viewAngle,
    position: visionState.lastPosition
  } : undefined
};
```

## What Frontend Needs to Do

### 1. Use the Vision Data
```typescript
socket.on('game:state', (state) => {
  if (state.vision?.visiblePixels) {
    // state.vision.visiblePixels is an array of "x,y" strings
    // Each string represents a visible pixel
  }
});
```

### 2. Render Fog Based on Visible Pixels
- Create a black fog overlay texture
- Cut out (erase) the visible pixels
- Apply as overlay or mask

## Expected Behavior

1. **Intact Walls**: Block vision completely
2. **Damaged Walls**: Small holes where bullets hit allow partial vision
3. **Destroyed Walls**: Full vision through destroyed sections
4. **Performance**: Vision updates only when player moves >2px or rotates >5°

## Testing

Use `test-vision.js` to verify:
- Players can't see through walls
- Destroying walls allows vision
- Peripheral vision respects walls
- Mouse direction extension stops at walls

## Key Points

- Backend wall occlusion logic was **already correct** ✅
- Issue was **missing data transmission** ❌
- Fix was to **include vision data in game state** ✅
- Frontend must **use this data to render fog** 🎨
