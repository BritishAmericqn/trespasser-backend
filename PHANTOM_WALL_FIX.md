# ðŸ”§ Phantom Wall Fix

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: "Phantom walls" that can be shot through (backend thinks they're destroyed) but still cast shadows and appear solid (vision system thinks they're intact)

**Key Symptoms**:
- Bullets pass through certain walls without registering hits
- Explosions successfully destroy these phantom walls
- Vision system still renders shadows from these walls
- Only affects some walls, sometimes angle-dependent
- Started after implementing the piercing system

## Root Cause

The weapon penetration logic was incorrectly treating **pre-destroyed slices** (from partial walls) as "penetrable obstacles" instead of empty space:

```typescript
// WRONG: Using penetration logic for destroyed slices
if (shouldSliceAllowPenetration(...)) {
  // Skip and continue ray...
}

// CORRECT: Check if slice is actually destroyed
if (wall.sliceHealth[sliceIndex] <= 0) {
  // Skip destroyed slice
}
```

## Why Explosions Worked

Explosions use `DestructionSystem.applyDamage()` directly, which:
1. Checks if slice health > 0 before applying damage
2. Returns null for already destroyed slices
3. Never treats destroyed slices as "obstacles"

## The Fix

### 1. WeaponSystem Changes

Changed hitscan raycast to check actual health instead of penetration logic:

```typescript
// Check if slice is already destroyed (health = 0)
if (wall.sliceHealth[sliceIndex] <= 0) {
  // Slice is destroyed - ray continues without damage reduction
  continue;
}
```

### 2. ProjectileSystem Changes

Updated projectile collision to use the same logic:

```typescript
// Check if slice is destroyed
if (wall.sliceHealth[sliceIndex] <= 0) {
  continue; // Pass through destroyed slice
}
```

### 3. Performance Improvements

Removed numerous console.log statements that were causing performance degradation:
- Shotgun pellet tracking logs
- Weapon event broadcast logs
- Explosion damage logs
- Wall initialization logs

## Testing

1. Fire at partial walls - bullets should pass through pre-destroyed sections
2. Fire at damaged soft walls - bullets should hit until health reaches 0
3. Check performance - should be noticeably improved
4. Verify explosions still work correctly

## Technical Details

**Partial Walls**: When the map loader creates walls shorter than 5 tiles, it pre-destroys certain slices (sets health = 0). These need to be treated as empty space, not obstacles.
