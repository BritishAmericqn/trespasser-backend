# Smoke Grenades & Vision System - FULLY WORKING âœ…

## Status: COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL

The smoke grenades are now fully working just like regular frag grenades!

### What's Working

1. **Smoke Grenade Mechanics**
   - âœ… Smoke grenades can be thrown like frag grenades
   - âœ… 2-second fuse time before smoke deployment
   - âœ… Smoke zones are created on explosion
   - âœ… Smoke zones persist for 8 seconds
   - âœ… Smoke expands over 1.5 seconds
   - âœ… No drift (stationary smoke)

2. **Vision System Integration**
   - âœ… Smoke zones are included in game state
   - âœ… Vision polygons are clipped by smoke zones
   - âœ… Vision is blocked at 70% opacity threshold
   - âœ… Multiple smoke zones can stack

3. **Confirmed Working (from server logs)**
   ```
   ðŸ’¨ Smoke zone created at (44.2, 85.0) with ID projectile_1
   ðŸ’¨ Active smoke zones: 1
   ðŸ’¨ Including 1 smoke zone(s) in game state for player
   ```

### Code Changes Made

1. **Fixed ProjectileSystem explosion handling**
   - Added proper smoke/flash explosion type detection for stuck grenades
   - Added proper smoke/flash explosion type detection for range-exceeded grenades

2. **Added smoke zones to GameState**
   - Updated GameState interface to include smokeZones field
   - Updated both getState() and getFilteredGameState() methods

3. **Updated Smoke Configuration**
   - Duration: 8 seconds
   - Expansion: 1.5 seconds
   - No drift (wind speed = 0)

### How It Works

1. Player equips smoke grenade in loadout
2. Player switches to smoke grenade weapon
3. Player fires (throws) the smoke grenade
4. After 2-second fuse, grenade explodes creating smoke zone
5. Smoke zone expands to full size over 1.5 seconds
6. Vision is blocked through smoke (70% opacity threshold)
7. Smoke persists for 8 seconds total before dispersing

The system is ready for frontend integration to render the smoke effects visually!
