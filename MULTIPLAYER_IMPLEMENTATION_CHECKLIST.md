### Day 3: Connection Management âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Implement player tracking**
  - Maintain set of authenticated players
  - Handle disconnection cleanup
  - Add player count limits (8 max)
  
- [x] **Create status endpoint**
  - GET / returns server info JSON
  - Include player count, password requirement
  - Used by frontend to check server before connecting

### Day 4: Testing & Documentation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Test LAN connectivity**
  - Verify connections work across local network
  - Test with multiple simultaneous players
