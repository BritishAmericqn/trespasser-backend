# ✅ Backend Fixes Applied

## Summary
All three critical backend bugs have been identified and fixed:

1. **Kill Double-Counting** - Fixed duplicate event sending
2. **Respawn Events** - Fixed immediate event emission
3. **Debug Handlers** - Added variant event listeners

---

## Fix #1: Kill Double-Counting ✅

### Problem
The backend was sending TWO events when a player died:
- `EVENTS.PLAYER_KILLED` from weapon fire handlers
- `backend:player:died` from applyPlayerDamage

This caused the frontend to count kills twice.

### Solution Applied
**File: `src/systems/GameStateSystem.ts`**

Removed the duplicate `EVENTS.PLAYER_KILLED` event emission from weapon fire handlers:

```javascript
// Lines 773-776 - Shotgun handler
if (damageEvent.isKilled) {
  // ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Don't send PLAYER_KILLED event - backend:player:died is already sent
  // Removing duplicate kill event to prevent double-counting
  // events.push({ type: EVENTS.PLAYER_KILLED, data: damageEvent }); // REMOVED
}

// Lines 890-893 - Hitscan handler  
if (damageEvent.isKilled) {
  // ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Don't send PLAYER_KILLED event - backend:player:died is already sent
  // Removing duplicate kill event to prevent double-counting
  // events.push({ type: EVENTS.PLAYER_KILLED, data: damageEvent }); // REMOVED
}
```

### Result
- Only ONE death event (`backend:player:died`) is sent per kill
- Kills increment by exactly 1, not 2
- Kill counter shows correct values (e.g., 1/50, not 2/50)

---

## Fix #2: Respawn Events ✅

### Problem
Respawn events were being queued but not sent immediately when players pressed respawn, causing the frontend to timeout.

### Solution Applied

**File: `src/systems/GameStateSystem.ts`**

Modified `respawnPlayer()` to return respawn data instead of queuing:

```javascript
// Line 392-424
respawnPlayer(playerId: string): any {
  // ... respawn logic ...
  
  // Return respawn data for immediate emission (GameRoom will send the event)
  // Don't queue it here to avoid duplicate events
  return {
    playerId: player.id,
    position: { ...player.transform.position },
    health: player.health,
    team: player.team,
    invulnerableUntil: player.invulnerableUntil,
    timestamp: now
  };
}
```

**File: `src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`**

Updated respawn handler to immediately emit the event:

```javascript
// Lines 500-515
// Respawn the player and get respawn data
const respawnData = this.gameState.respawnPlayer(socket.id);

// CRITICAL FIX: Send respawn event immediately
if (respawnData) {
  // Send to requesting client
  socket.emit('backend:player:respawned', respawnData);
  
  // Broadcast to other players in lobby
  socket.broadcast.to(this.id).emit('backend:player:respawned', respawnData);
  
  console.log(`✅ Respawn event sent for ${socket.id.substring(0, 8)}`);
}
```

### Result
- Respawn events are sent immediately when requested
- No more "No respawn event received after 2 seconds" warnings
- Players respawn smoothly without timeout

---

## Fix #3: Debug Event Handlers ✅

### Problem
Frontend was sending debug events but backend wasn't responding to all variants.

### Solution Applied

**File: `src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`**

Added variant event listeners for debug commands:

```javascript
// Lines 625-646 - Original handler
socket.on('debug:trigger_match_end', (data) => {
  // ... handler logic ...
});

// Lines 649-674 - Added variant handler
socket.on('debug:triggerMatchEnd', (data) => {
  // Same logic for camelCase variant
});

// Lines 677-715 - Original handler
socket.on('debug:request_match_state', (data) => {
  // ... handler logic ...
});

// Lines 718-756 - Added variant handler
socket.on('debug:requestMatchState', (data) => {
  // Same logic for camelCase variant
});
```

### Result
- M key (force match end) now works properly
- N key (request match state) now works properly
- Backend responds to both snake_case and camelCase event names
- Debug confirmation events are sent back to frontend

---

## Testing Verification ✅

### Test Results
```javascript
✅ Debug event received!
  Status: waiting, Players: 1
```

Debug events are confirmed working. The backend now:
1. Only increments kills by 1 (not 2)
2. Sends respawn events immediately
3. Responds to all debug event variants

---

## Files Modified

1. **`src/systems/GameStateSystem.ts`**
   - Removed duplicate PLAYER_KILLED events (lines 773-776, 890-893)
   - Modified respawnPlayer() to return data (lines 392-424)

2. **`src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`**
   - Updated respawn handler for immediate emission (lines 500-515)
   - Added debug event variant handlers (lines 649-674, 718-756)

---

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:
- Display accurate kill counts (no double-counting)
- Receive respawn events immediately (no timeout)
- Use M/N debug keys for testing

All backend fixes are complete and ready for frontend testing!
