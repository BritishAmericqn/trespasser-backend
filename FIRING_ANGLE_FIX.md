# üéØ Fixed: Firing Angle While Moving

## The Problem
When moving and firing at a fixed point on the screen, the firing angle wasn't updating. The bullets would go in the wrong direction as if the player was still at their original position.

## The Cause
The backend was using the frontend's `direction` value from the weapon:fire event instead of the server's calculated `player.transform.rotation`.

### What Was Happening:
1. Player moves from A to B while aiming at point C
2. Backend correctly updates `player.transform.rotation` as player moves
3. But when firing, it used frontend's `event.direction` (angle from A to C)
4. Should have used server's rotation (angle from B to C)

## The Fix Applied
```typescript
// GameRoom.ts - Line 67
// BEFORE:
direction: event.direction,  // ‚ùå Uses stale frontend angle

// AFTER:
direction: player.transform.rotation,  // ‚úÖ Uses current server angle
```

## What This Means

### For Backend (Already Fixed ‚úÖ)
- Server now always uses its authoritative rotation
- Rotation updates every frame as player moves
- Firing angle is always correct relative to current position

### For Frontend
- You can still send `direction` in weapon:fire events (for logging)
- But backend will ignore it and use server rotation
- Server rotation is updated via player:input events

## Debug Output
You'll now see angle comparisons in the console:
```
üéØ ANGLE CHECK:
   Client sent: 45.0¬∞
   Server has:  52.3¬∞
   Difference:  7.3¬∞
```

This shows how the angle changes as you move!

## Testing
1. Stand still and fire at a wall - note the angle
2. Move sideways while firing at the same wall
3. The angle should change as you move
4. Bullets should always go toward where you're aiming

## Why This Matters
- **Predictive aiming**: Players can lead targets while moving
- **Accurate physics**: Bullets go where players expect
- **Fair gameplay**: No advantage from client-side angle manipulation
