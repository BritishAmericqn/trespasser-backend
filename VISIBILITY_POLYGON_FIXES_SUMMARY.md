# Visibility Polygon System - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vision Leak Through Walls (Original Tile System)
- **Problem**: Destroying 1 slice (10px) allowed vision through entire 50px wall
- **Solution**: Implemented slice-aware raycasting in TileVisionSystem

### 2. Polygon System Performance
- **Problem**: EdgePerfectVisionSystem caused 88.9% CPU usage
- **Solution**: Switched to visibility polygon algorithm using wall corners

### 3. Wall ID Tracking
- **Problem**: Wall IDs weren't preserved between systems
- **Solution**: Updated initialization to preserve IDs from DestructionSystem

### 4. Destroyed Slice Corner Generation
- **Problem**: Incorrect logic for adding corners at destruction boundaries
- **Solution**: Fixed to check all 6 boundaries between 5 slices

### 5. Arc Segment Cutoffs
- **Problem**: Straight lines (secants) between sparse points cut off vision areas
- **Solution**: Added intermediate arc points when angular gaps > 10°

### 6. Weird Cone Artifacts (Current)
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Self-intersecting polygon edges
  - Incorrect angle sorting with wrap-around
  - Points added in wrong order
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Proper angle normalization relative to view direction
  - FOV filtering for corner angles
  - Simplified polygon construction

## Current Algorithm

1. Find wall corners within FOV
2. Build angle list: [leftBound, ...cornerAngles, rightBound]
3. Sort angles relative to view direction
4. Cast rays and add arc interpolation
5. Return points forming a fan from player position

## Debugging Tips

- Enable logging to see angle calculations
- Check if polygon is self-intersecting
- Verify winding order is consistent
- Test with different view directions (especially near 0°/360°)
