# ðŸŽ¯ Hitscan Collision Detection - Final Solution

## Problem History
The hitscan collision detection issue was a persistent problem where bullets would hit "invisible" parts of walls. This occurred specifically with partial walls (walls shorter than 5 tiles) that had pre-destroyed slices.

## Root Cause
When walls are created with the 5-slice system:
- All walls have dimensions of 50x10 or 10x50 pixels (5 tiles)
- Shorter walls (e.g., 3 tiles) still have the full 50px bounding box
- The "extra" tiles are marked as pre-destroyed slices
- The original hitscan code was checking collision against the full 50px box
- This caused bullets to hit the invisible pre-destroyed sections

## The Solution
Modified `checkWallHit()` in `WeaponSystem.ts` to check each slice individually:

### Key Changes:
1. **Per-Slice Collision Detection**: Instead of checking the entire wall bounding box, we now check each intact slice separately
2. **Skip Destroyed Slices**: Slices marked as destroyed (value 1 in destructionMask) are completely ignored
3. **Individual Slice Bounds**: Each slice gets its own 10x10 pixel bounding box for collision

### Implementation Details:
```typescript
// Check each intact slice individually
const intactSlices: number[] = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (!wall.destructionMask || wall.destructionMask[i] === 0) {
    intactSlices.push(i);
  }
}

// For each intact slice, calculate its specific bounds
for (const sliceIndex of intactSlices) {
  const sliceBounds = this.getSliceBounds(wall, sliceIndex);
  // Perform ray-AABB intersection on this slice only
}
```

## Wall Structure (Preserved)
- **Horizontal walls**: Always 50x10 pixels (5 slices of 10x10)
- **Vertical walls**: Always 10x50 pixels (5 slices of 10x10)
- **Partial walls**: Full dimensions with pre-destroyed slices
  - Example: 3-tile wall = 50x10 with slices [0,1,2] intact, [3,4] pre-destroyed

## Impact
- âœ… Hitscan bullets only hit visible wall sections
- âœ… Pre-destroyed slices are properly ignored
- âœ… Wall visual representation matches collision detection
- âœ… Original 5-slice structure maintained
- âœ… Destruction system continues to work correctly

## Testing Confirmed
The fix has been verified in production with the user confirming that hitscan collision detection now works correctly for all wall types, including partial walls with pre-destroyed slices.

## Technical Note
This solution elegantly maintains backward compatibility with the existing destruction system while providing accurate collision detection. The key insight was that we needed to check collision at the slice level rather than the wall level for hitscan weapons.
