# Weapon System Readiness Evaluation

## Current Status

### ✅ WORKING (Pistol Standard)
- **PISTOL**: Fires, deals damage, reloads, hit markers work

### ❌ PRIMARY WEAPONS NOT WORKING
1. **RIFLE**: Unknown status
2. **SMG**: No hit markers reported
3. **SHOTGUN**: No shots going out
4. **BATTLERIFLE**: Unknown status
5. **SNIPERRIFLE**: Unknown status

### ❌ SECONDARY WEAPONS NOT WORKING
1. **REVOLVER**: Can't shoot

1. **ROCKET**: Can't fire, no projectiles
2. **GRENADELAUNCHER**: Unknown status
3. **MACHINEGUN**: Unknown status
4. **ANTIMATERIALRIFLE**: Unknown status

### ⚠️ THROWN WEAPONS PARTIAL
1. **GRENADE**: Works but had timer issues
2. **SMOKEGRENADE**: Unknown status
3. **FLASHBANG**: Unknown status

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. **Projectile Weapons Not Creating Projectiles**
- Rocket launcher doesn't fire anything
- Need to check projectile creation for all non-hitscan weapons

### 2. **Hitscan Weapons Not Registering Hits**
- SMG not showing hit markers
- Revolver can't shoot
- Shotgun has no shots going out

### 3. **Special Mechanics Not Working**
- Shotgun spread not generating pellets
- Machine gun heat system untested
- Anti-material rifle penetration untested

## Fix Priority

1. **Fix All Hitscan Primaries/Secondaries** (to match pistol)
   - Ensure fire events are processed
   - Ensure damage is calculated
   - Ensure hit markers are sent

2. **Fix Projectile Weapons**
   - Rocket launcher
   - Grenade launcher
   - Ensure projectiles are created and tracked

3. **Fix Special Mechanics**
   - Shotgun pellet spread
   - Machine gun overheating
   - Anti-material penetration

## Root Causes to Investigate

1. **Weapon Type Mismatches**: Frontend might be sending wrong weapon types
2. **Event Handler Issues**: Some weapon types might not be handled properly
3. **Projectile Creation**: Non-hitscan weapons might have broken projectile creation
4. **Special Case Handling**: Shotgun/machine gun special code might be broken
