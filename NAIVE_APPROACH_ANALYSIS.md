# üîç Naive Approach Analysis - Why The Server Still Crashes

## The Fundamental Problem

We're trying to calculate **pixel-perfect vision** for a multiplayer game. This is naive because:

### 1. **Pixel-Level Precision is Overkill**
- We're checking 3,600+ individual pixels per player
- Creating a string `"x,y"` for EACH visible pixel
- Games like Among Us use **tile-based** or **region-based** vision

### 2. **String Creation Hell**
```typescript
visiblePixels.add(`${x},${y}`); // Creates new string for EVERY pixel!
```
- With 3,600 pixels √ó 8 players = 28,800 string allocations
- JavaScript strings are immutable = massive garbage collection
- This happens 10 times per second!

### 3. **We're Still Calculating What We Don't Use**
- We disabled sending vision data but STILL calculate it
- The server does millions of operations for nothing
- Like rendering graphics on a server with no display!

### 4. **Synchronous Blocking Calculations**
- Vision runs on the main thread
- Blocks the event loop for milliseconds
- Node.js eventually gives up (SIGTERM)

## Better Approaches Used by Real Games

### 1. **Tile-Based Vision** (Among Us, Stardew Valley)
- Divide world into 16x16 or 32x32 tiles
- Only track visible tiles, not pixels
- 480x270 pixels = 30x17 tiles (510 tiles vs 129,600 pixels!)

### 2. **Angle-Based Vision** (CS:GO, Valorant)
- Store vision as angle ranges: "player can see 45¬∞ to 135¬∞"
- Check if objects fall within angle range
- No pixel iteration needed

### 3. **Distance-Based Circles** (Battle Royale games)
- Simple radius check: "Can see everything within 100 units"
- Wall occlusion done with ray casts to specific targets
- Not every pixel, just important objects

### 4. **Async/Worker Thread Processing**
- Move heavy calculations off main thread
- Use Web Workers or Worker Threads
- Main thread stays responsive

## The Solution We Need

**STOP CALCULATING INDIVIDUAL PIXELS!**

Instead:
1. Use tile-based vision (16x16 tiles)
2. Only calculate when players move between tiles
3. Store visibility as bit flags, not strings
4. Only raycast to specific targets (other players)
