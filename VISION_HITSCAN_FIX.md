# Critical Fix: Vision System Not Updated for Hitscan Weapons

## The Bug

Vision system wasn't recognizing walls destroyed by rifles/pistols, only by rockets/explosions.

## Root Cause

The `onWallDestroyed` method was only being called for:
- ‚úÖ Projectile collisions (rockets)
- ‚úÖ Explosions (grenades/rockets)
- ‚ùå **NOT for hitscan weapons (rifle/pistol)**

This meant that when you shot a wall with a rifle:
1. The destruction system properly tracked the damage ‚úÖ
2. The wall visually appeared destroyed ‚úÖ
3. But the vision system was never notified ‚ùå
4. So fog of war still blocked vision ‚ùå

## The Fix

Added the missing `onWallDestroyed` call in the hitscan weapon handling:

```typescript
// In handleWeaponFire for hitscan weapons
if (damageEvent) {
    // ... existing damage handling ...
    
    // NEW: Notify vision system of wall damage
    this.visionSystem.onWallDestroyed(
        hitscanResult.targetId!,
        wall,
        damageEvent.sliceIndex
    );
}
```

## Testing

With the new debugging logs, you should see:
1. `üîç onWallDestroyed called for wall_X slice Y` when shooting walls
2. Vision should now pass through ANY wall with destroyed slices
3. Fog of war should update properly when walls are damaged

## Status

‚úÖ Fixed - Vision system now properly tracks ALL wall damage, not just explosions
