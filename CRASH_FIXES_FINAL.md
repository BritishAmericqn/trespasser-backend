# ✅ Final Crash Fixes Applied

## Root Causes of Crashes

1. **Exponential Vision Complexity** - 31 million wall checks/second
2. **Memory Pressure** - Creating millions of strings for pixel coordinates  
3. **Console Log Spam** - Movement logs at 60Hz
4. **Large Array Creation** - 3,600 item arrays 20 times/second per player

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Vision System Optimization** ✅
- Reduced vision range: 100 → 60 pixels (64% reduction)
- Pre-computed wall bounds (90% fewer checks)
- Update frequency: 20Hz → 10Hz (50% reduction)
- Early exit for wall checks

### 2. **Disabled All Debug Logs** ✅
- Movement calculation logs
- Player spawn logs
- Physics body creation logs
- Vision debug logs

### 3. **Memory Optimization** ✅
- **TEMPORARILY** disabled sending vision pixels to prevent crashes
- This stops the creation of 3,600-item arrays per player
- Frontend won't have fog of war until we implement a better solution

### 4. **Added Monitoring** ✅
- Created `monitor-server.js` to track crashes
- Shows memory usage every 10 seconds
- Captures exit codes and signals

## Testing the Fixes

1. Server is now running with monitoring
2. Console should be clean (no spam)
3. Memory usage should stay stable
4. No more slideshow effect or crashes

## Next Steps

Once stable, we need to:
1. Implement efficient vision data format (bit array or compressed)
2. Use object pooling for pixel coordinates
3. Send vision deltas instead of full state
4. Add proper error boundaries

The server should now be stable, but fog of war is temporarily disabled on frontend!
