# Vision and Weapon System - Complete Fix

## Problem Summary
When walls had destroyed slices, two major issues occurred:
1. **Vision Issue**: Players could see through entire walls via a single destroyed slice
2. **Weapon Issue**: Bullets couldn't pass through destroyed slices to hit walls behind

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Vision System Fix (VisibilityPolygonSystem)
- **Problem**: Rays would pass through destroyed slices and continue indefinitely
- **Solution**: Added `checkSliceBoundaries` method that:
  - Checks all vertical slice boundaries (0-5)
  - Identifies transitions between destroyed and intact slices
  - Treats these boundaries as "virtual walls"
  - Returns hit points where rays encounter intact slices

### 2. Weapon System Fix (WeaponSystem)
- **Problem**: Bullets would stop at the first wall, even if hitting a destroyed slice
- **Solution**: Rewrote `raycast` method to:
  - Collect ALL wall intersections along the ray path
  - Sort them by distance
  - Process in order, allowing rays to pass through destroyed slices
  - Continue checking walls behind destroyed slices
  - Only stop when hitting an intact slice

## Visual Example
```
Before (WRONG):
╔═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╗    ╔═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╗
║███║   ║███║███║███║    ║███║███║███║███║███║
╚═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╝    ╚═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╝
     ↓                    (Second wall unreachable)
     └─────────────────────────────────────────→

After (CORRECT):
╔═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╗    ╔═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╦═══╗
║███║   ║███║███║███║    ║███║███║███║███║███║
╚═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╝    ╚═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╩═══╝
     ↓                         ↓
     └─────────────────────────┘ (Bullet hits second wall)
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Realistic Physics**: Vision and shooting behave consistently
2. **Tactical Gameplay**: Players can shoot through destroyed "windows"
3. **Strategic Depth**: Can create sight lines through multiple walls
4. **Performance**: Efficient algorithms (O(n) where n = walls hit)

## Testing Scenarios
1. **Single Wall**: Destroy one slice, verify vision/shooting limited to that slice
2. **Multiple Walls**: Shoot through destroyed slice to hit wall behind
3. **Parallel Shooting**: Shoot along wall, verify hits on slice boundaries
4. **Complex Paths**: Create aligned destroyed slices for long sight lines
