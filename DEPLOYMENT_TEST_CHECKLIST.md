# 🚀 Deployment Test Checklist

**Deployment Time:** December 2024  
**Fixes Applied:** Authentication timing + Join confirmation  
**Git Commits:** 94a6930, 8ffed08

## 📋 Test Steps for Remote Machine

### 1. **Initial Connection Test**
- [ ] Open trespass.gg on remote machine
- [ ] Check browser console for connection messages
- [ ] Verify no "CORS" errors

### 2. **Authentication Test**
- [ ] Enter password if required
- [ ] Check for "authenticated" message in console
- [ ] Verify no timeout errors

### 3. **Lobby Join Test**
- [ ] Click matchmaking or join private lobby
- [ ] Verify lobby joined successfully
- [ ] Check for `player:join:success` event in console

### 4. **Game State Reception Test**
- [ ] Verify walls render (79 walls should be visible)
- [ ] Verify fog of war appears
- [ ] Check console for "Found player data in game state"

### 5. **Input Processing Test** (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Movement:** Use WASD - player should move WITHOUT rubber-banding
- [ ] **Rotation:** Move mouse - vision cone should follow mouse
- [ ] **Shooting:** Click to shoot - bullets should appear
- [ ] **Wall Damage:** Shoot walls - they should take damage

### 6. **Server Log Monitoring**
Check Railway logs for:
- [ ] NO "❌ DROPPING player:input" errors
- [ ] "✅ Sent player:join:success confirmation" message
- [ ] "🎮 Setting up game event handlers for authenticated" message

## 🔍 Expected Console Output (Frontend)

```javascript
// Good signs:
"✅ Player successfully joined as active player"
"Found player data in game state"
"Player position synced from game state"

// Bad signs (should NOT appear):
"❌ Failed to join"
"Backend not sending visiblePlayers"
"TypeError: Cannot read properties of null"
```

## 🔍 Expected Server Logs (Railway)

```
// Good signs:
🔌 Connection attempt from [IP]
✅ Player authenticated: [socket.id]
🎮 Setting up game event handlers for authenticated [socket.id]
✅ Sent player:join:success confirmation to [socket.id]

// Bad signs (should NOT appear):
❌ DROPPING player:input from [socket.id] - NOT AUTHENTICATED!
💥 Player not in room either
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The deployment is successful if:
1. ✅ Remote players can move without rubber-banding
2. ✅ Remote players can rotate vision with mouse
3. ✅ Remote players can shoot and damage walls
4. ✅ No authentication errors in server logs
5. ✅ `player:join:success` event received by frontend

## ❌ If Issues Persist

1. **Check Railway Logs:**
   - Look for "DROPPING" errors
   - Check for authentication failures
   - Verify player:join processing

2. **Check Frontend Console:**
   - Look for WebSocket errors
   - Check for missing events
   - Verify game state reception

3. **Debug Commands:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   window.gameScene?.networkSystem?.getSocket()?.emit('debug:request_match_state')
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring Links

- **Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app/dashboard
- **Server Logs:** Check Railway deployment logs
- **Live Site:** https://trespass.gg

## 🎯 Frontend Integration

The frontend should now listen for:
```javascript
socket.on('player:join:success', (data) => {
  console.log('Player is active:', data);
  // Enable input processing
});

socket.on('player:join:failed', (data) => {
  console.error('Join failed:', data.reason);
  // Handle as observer or retry
});
```

**Railway should be deploying now. Wait ~2-3 minutes for build and deployment to complete.**
