# Weapon System Final Fix

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Weapon Slot Costs Were Wrong** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Rocket was 3 slots (should be 2), Machine gun/Anti-material were 2 slots (should be 3)
- **Fix**: Updated slot costs in constants

### 2. **Default Loadout for Testing**
- Changed to include rifle, revolver, rocket + grenade for comprehensive testing
- This tests primary hitscan, secondary hitscan, and projectile weapons

### 3. **Debug Logging Added**
- Added comprehensive logging to track weapon firing, switching, and configuration
- This will help diagnose any remaining issues

## Weapon Categories and Expected Behavior

### Primary Weapons (Hitscan)
1. **RIFLE** - Standard assault rifle, 30 rounds, 600 RPM
2. **SMG** - High fire rate, 35 rounds, 900 RPM  
3. **SHOTGUN** - 8 pellets per shot, spread pattern
4. **BATTLERIFLE** - Higher damage, 20 rounds, 450 RPM
5. **SNIPERRIFLE** - High damage, 5 rounds, 40 RPM

### Secondary Weapons (Hitscan)
1. **PISTOL** - âœ… WORKING - The baseline
2. **REVOLVER** - High damage, 6 rounds, 150 RPM
3. **SUPPRESSEDPISTOL** - Quieter, 15 rounds

### Support Weapons
1. **ROCKET** (2 slots) - Projectile, explosive
2. **GRENADELAUNCHER** (2 slots) - Arc trajectory projectile
3. **MACHINEGUN** (3 slots) - Hitscan with heat system
4. **ANTIMATERIALRIFLE** (3 slots) - Hitscan with penetration

### Thrown Weapons (1 slot each)
1. **GRENADE** - 3 second fuse, explosive
2. **SMOKEGRENADE** - 2 second fuse, vision blocking
3. **FLASHBANG** - 1.5 second fuse, blinds players

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build and Start Server**:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

2. **Run Weapon Test**:
```bash
node tests/weapon-test-all.js
```

3. **Manual Testing**:
- Key 1: Primary weapon
- Key 2: Secondary weapon  
- Key 3: First support weapon
- Key 4: Second support weapon
- Left Click: Fire
- R: Reload
- G: Throw grenade (if throwable equipped)

## Expected Console Output

When firing weapons, you should see:
```
ðŸ”« handleWeaponFire called - player: abc12345, weapon: rifle
ðŸ“‹ Weapon Config: type=rifle, hitscan=true, damage=25, ammo=29/30
ðŸ”« Weapon fired: rifle, HITSCAN: true, player: abc12345
```

For projectiles:
```
ðŸš€ Creating rocket projectile - speed: 200, damage: 100
ðŸš€ ROCKET CREATED:
   ID: rocket_123
   Position: (240.0, 135.0)
   Velocity: (200.0, 0.0) = 200.0 px/s
```

## Frontend Integration Requirements

The frontend needs to:
1. Send correct weapon type names in `weapon:fire` events
2. Include `pelletCount: 8` for shotgun fire events
3. Handle all weapon switch events properly
4. Display projectiles for rocket/grenade launcher
5. Show heat indicator for machine gun
6. Display penetration effects for anti-material rifle

## Known Issues Still Being Investigated

1. **Shotgun pellets** - Need to verify pellet spread is visible
2. **Rocket explosions** - Need to ensure explosion damage is applied
3. **Machine gun heat** - Need to test overheating mechanics
4. **Anti-material penetration** - Need to verify multi-hit functionality
