# 🔫 Shooting Issue Fix Status

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Partial Fix Deployed  
**Issue:** Players can move but cannot shoot

## ✅ What's Fixed
- **Movement works** - Validation bypass allows movement
- **Timestamp tolerance increased** - From 1s to 5s (handles 2616ms clock drift)
- **Debug logging added** - Will show exact issue

## 🔍 What We Found

From Railway logs:
```
⏰ Input rejected for i08dkjc9: timestamp diff 2616ms
timestamp: 1755760990199
serverTime: 1755760987583
```

**The frontend's clock is 2.6 seconds AHEAD of server time!**

## 🎯 Why Shooting Doesn't Work (Likely Causes)

### 1. **Frontend Not Sending `mouse.leftPressed`**
The frontend might be:
- Not setting `input.mouse.leftPressed = true` on click
- Only setting `mouse.buttons` but not `leftPressed`
- Sending click as separate event instead of in InputState

### 2. **Player Has No Weapon**
Check if:
- Loadout was sent properly in `player:join`
- Weapons were equipped successfully
- `player.weaponId` is set

### 3. **Weapon State Issue**
- Weapon might be reloading
- Weapon might be out of ammo
- Weapon config might be missing

## 📊 What Railway Logs Will Show Now

With new debugging, you'll see:

```javascript
// When clicking to shoot:
🖱️ Mouse input for [playerId]: {
  leftPressed: false,  // ← If false, frontend issue!
  buttons: 1,
  hasWeapon: true,
  currentWeapon: 'rifle'
}

// When joining:
🔫 Weapons equipped for [playerId]: {
  weapons: ['rifle', 'pistol'],
  currentWeapon: 'rifle',
  weaponCount: 2
}
```

## 🔧 Quick Fix for Frontend

Make sure `InputState` includes:
```javascript
mouse: {
  x: mouseX,
  y: mouseY,
  buttons: mouseButtons,
  leftPressed: isLeftMouseDown,  // ← MUST be true when shooting!
  rightPressed: isRightMouseDown,
  leftReleased: wasLeftReleased,
  rightReleased: wasRightReleased
}
```

## 📝 Test Checklist

1. [ ] Check Railway logs for `🖱️ Mouse input`
2. [ ] Verify `leftPressed: true` when clicking
3. [ ] Check `🔫 Weapons equipped` shows weapons
4. [ ] Verify `currentWeapon` is not empty

## 🚀 Next Deployment

The fix with increased timestamp tolerance and debug logging is deploying now (2-3 mins).

Once deployed:
1. Try shooting again
2. Check Railway logs for mouse input debug
3. Share what `leftPressed` shows

## 💡 Temporary Workaround

If frontend can't fix immediately, we can change backend to:
```javascript
// Use buttons instead of leftPressed
if (input.mouse.leftPressed || (input.mouse.buttons & 1)) {
  // Fire weapon
}
```
