# Match Start Logic Update

## Overview
Successfully implemented sophisticated match start logic with dynamic countdown timers and player count thresholds.

## New Match Start Rules

### Player Count Conditions
- **8/8 players**: Match starts immediately (1-second transition)
- **2-7 players**: 10-second countdown timer starts
- **<2 players**: No match start, cancels any active countdown

### Timer Behavior
- **Timer Reset**: When a new player joins during countdown (2-7 players), the timer resets to 10 seconds
- **Immediate Override**: If the 8th player joins during countdown, immediately starts match
- **Cancellation**: If players leave and count drops below 2, countdown is cancelled

## Key Changes Made

### 1. LobbyManager.ts
- Changed countdown from 5 to 10 seconds
- Added `startTimers` Map to track timer references for proper cancellation
- Implemented `startMatchImmediately()` method for 8-player instant start
- Added timer reset logic when new players join
- Fixed duplicate match start logic between `findOrCreateLobby` and `onPlayerCountChange`
- Removed hardcoded 3-second countdowns that were overriding actual values

### 2. index.ts
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed global `MAX_PLAYERS` limit that was blocking 8th player
- Server was rejecting connections at socket level, not lobby level
- Now supports unlimited total connections (limited per-lobby instead)

### 3. Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate `match_starting` events with incorrect countdown values
- Removed conflicting match start triggers in multiple locations
- Properly cancel and cleanup timers to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed race conditions in player join/leave scenarios

## Testing Results
✅ 2 players trigger 10-second countdown
✅ Timer resets when players 3-7 join
✅ 8 players trigger immediate start (1-second)
✅ Countdown cancels when dropping below 2 players
✅ Multiple lobbies can run independently with their own timers

## Implementation Details

### Timer Management
```typescript
private startTimers: Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout> = new Map();
```
Tracks actual timer references for proper cancellation and prevents orphaned timers.

### Player Count Callback
The `onPlayerCountChange` callback now handles all match start logic centrally:
- Checks for 8 players → immediate start
- Checks for 2-7 players → schedule/reset timer
- Checks for <2 players → cancel timer

### Event Flow
1. Player joins lobby
2. `onPlayerCountChange` fires
3. Logic determines appropriate action
4. Broadcasts countdown to all players
5. Match starts when conditions are met

## Notes
- Frontend receives `match_starting` event with `countdown` value in seconds
- Frontend should display countdown timer to players
- Match starts are completely backend-controlled for security
- Each lobby manages its own match start independently
