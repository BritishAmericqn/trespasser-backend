# Weapon System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented 15 weapon types across Primary, Secondary, Support, and Thrown categories with unique mechanics and network events.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Player Position Bug in Explosions** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `processExplosions` was checking `player.position` instead of `player.transform.position`
- **Impact**: Explosions (rockets, grenades) dealt no damage to players
- **Fix**: Updated to use correct property path

### 2. **Grenade Timer Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Grenades weren't exploding after 3 seconds
- **Impact**: Grenades would disappear without exploding
- **Fix**: Ensured fuseTime is set correctly, auto-convert fire events to throw events

### 3. **Weapon Initialization** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Players only had default weapons (rifle, pistol, grenade)
- **Impact**: New weapons couldn't be tested
- **Fix**: Updated player loadout, added debug commands

### 4. **Throwable Weapon Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Only 'grenade' type was handled in throw events
- **Impact**: Smoke grenades and flashbangs couldn't be thrown
- **Fix**: Check equipped weapon type for all throwables

## Weapon Categories Implemented

### Primary Weapons (5)
- ✅ Rifle - Standard assault rifle (hitscan)
- ✅ SMG - High fire rate, lower damage (hitscan)
- ✅ Shotgun - 8 pellet spread (hitscan)
- ✅ Battle Rifle - High damage, slower fire (hitscan)
- ✅ Sniper Rifle - Highest damage, slowest fire (hitscan)

### Secondary Weapons (3)
- ✅ Pistol - Balanced sidearm (hitscan)
- ✅ Revolver - High damage, slow fire (hitscan)
- ✅ Suppressed Pistol - Quiet, moderate damage (hitscan)

### Support Weapons (4)
- ✅ Grenade Launcher - Arc trajectory projectiles
- ✅ Machine Gun - Heat management system
- ✅ Anti-Material Rifle - Multi-target penetration
- ✅ Rocket Launcher - Explosive projectiles

### Thrown Weapons (3)
- ✅ Grenade - Charge system, 3s fuse
- ✅ Smoke Grenade - Vision blocking (Phase 2)
- ✅ Flashbang - Blind effect (Phase 2)

## Special Mechanics Implemented

### 1. **Shotgun Spread**
- Generates 8 pellets with random spread
- Each pellet does 1/8 of total damage
- Spread angle configurable

### 2. **Machine Gun Heat**
- Heat builds up with firing
- Overheats at 100 heat units
- 3-second cooldown penalty
- Heat events broadcast to clients

### 3. **Anti-Material Penetration**
- Can penetrate up to 3 targets
- Damage reduces with each penetration
- Stops at hard walls (concrete)

### 4. **Projectile Physics**
- Grenades bounce with friction
- Grenade launcher uses arc trajectory
- Rockets fly straight, explode on impact

### 5. **Explosion System**
- Damage based on distance from center
- Affects multiple targets in radius
- Destroys wall slices

## Network Events

All weapon actions generate appropriate network events:
- `weapon:fired` - When any weapon fires
- `weapon:hit` - When hitscan hits target
- `weapon:reloaded` - When reload completes
- `weapon:switched` - When changing weapons
- `grenade:thrown` - When throwing grenades
- `projectile:created` - For rockets/grenades
- `projectile:exploded` - For explosions
- `weapon:heat:update` - Machine gun heat changes

## Current Default Loadout

```javascript
{
  primary: 'smg',
  secondary: 'pistol',
  support: ['rocket'] // 3 slots
}
```

## Debug Commands

```javascript
// Give specific weapon
socket.emit('debug:give_weapon', 'shotgun');
socket.emit('debug:give_weapon', 'machinegun');
socket.emit('debug:give_weapon', 'antimaterialrifle');

// Test grenade throwing
socket.emit('debug:throw_grenade');
```

## Remaining Work

1. **Phase 2 Mechanics**:
   - Smoke grenade vision blocking
   - Flashbang blinding effects

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Ensure weapon type names match
   - Handle all weapon events
   - Show appropriate UI/effects

3. **Balance Testing**:
   - Adjust damage values
   - Tune fire rates
   - Test reload times

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be Careful with Property Paths**: The explosion bug shows the importance of verifying object structures
2. **Test Each Feature**: Don't assume similar code works - test each weapon type
3. **Add Debug Logging**: Makes finding issues much easier
4. **Consider Frontend Integration**: Backend changes need frontend support
