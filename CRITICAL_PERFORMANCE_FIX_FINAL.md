# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: The REAL Performance Issue

## The Main Culprit: Matter.js Physics Engine

**Matter.js is running at 60Hz even when NOTHING is happening!**

This is why your laptop is getting hot. The physics engine is:
- Updating all wall bodies (12 walls)
- Checking collisions between everything
- Running physics calculations
- 60 times per second
- Even with 0 projectiles and stationary players!

## Immediate Fix

### 1. Only Run Physics When Needed

```typescript
// src/systems/PhysicsSystem.ts
private bodiesInMotion: Set<string> = new Set();

update(delta: number): void {
  // ONLY run physics if something is actually moving
  if (this.bodiesInMotion.size > 0) {
    Matter.Engine.update(this.engine, delta);
  }
}

addMovingBody(id: string) {
  this.bodiesInMotion.add(id);
}

removeMovingBody(id: string) {
  this.bodiesInMotion.delete(id);
}
```

### 2. The Real Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Matter.js at 60Hz** - Even with nothing moving (BIGGEST ISSUE)
2. **Console logs** - Still appearing from somewhere
3. **Vision calculations** - Running too often
4. **No early exits** - Systems running with no data

## Why Your Laptop is Hot

Every frame (16.67ms), the game is:
1. Running Matter.js physics simulation
2. Checking all wall collisions  
3. Updating all physics bodies
4. Processing empty projectile lists
5. All for NOTHING when players aren't moving!

## Quick Test

To prove this is the issue, try this:
1. Comment out `this.physics.update()` in GameRoom.ts
2. The game will break BUT your laptop will cool down immediately

## The Mystery Logs

The "Walls available for collision" logs suggest:
1. You might have multiple server instances running
2. Or the browser is caching old JavaScript
3. Or there's a build issue

Try:
```bash
# Kill ALL node processes
pkill -9 node

# Clear everything
rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.cache

# Fresh install and build
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Expected Results After Fix

- CPU usage: Drop from 30-50% to 5-10%
- Laptop: Should barely get warm
- Performance: Like Among Us (which doesn't use physics at all!)

## Alternative: Remove Matter.js Entirely

Since you're not using physics for players anyway:
1. Use simple AABB collision for projectiles
2. Remove Matter.js dependency
3. Save massive CPU cycles

This is why Among Us works on phones - NO PHYSICS ENGINE!
